# Winc Academy Event App

## Final Front-end Development Assignment

### Author: Ben Janssen

**Version :** 2.08.75

### Discription:

This is a simple event registration app, that allows a user to login and create/modify/delete an event.

### Version control:

2 stands for the version obviously.
08 are the faces that i have plannend to create the app.
75 are the total changes/uploads to the code/github.

### Disclaimer:

Due to the progress of learning, there might still be some errors of bad coding.
Some, like routing and errorboundary's where difficult to pick up, and to implement on the go.
Hence version 2.

I decided to leave it like that, to show other people that want to learn Front-end, that a structured planning is very helpfull. (which i didn't ðŸ˜…)
